# Homebrew formula for ApolloShell - builds from source.
#
# Lives in the tap repository Silvertree2010/homebrew-apolloshell, so users
# run `brew tap Silvertree2010/apolloshell`. For a new release, update url and
# set sha256 to `shasum -a 256` of the release tarball.
#
# Only the Command Line Tools are needed (swift, clang, codesign, iconutil
# are not even required - the icon is prebuilt). Xcode is NOT required.

      ApolloShell.app is in:
        #{opt_prefix}/ApolloShell.app

      To find it in Spotlight and Launchpad, link it into ~/Applications:
        mkdir -p ~/Applications
        ln -sf "#{opt_prefix}/ApolloShell.app" ~/Applications/ApolloShell.app

      Permissions (System Settings > Privacy & Security):
        Accessibility  - window guard, dock window list and badges, Spaces
                         and keyboard actions. macOS asks on first launch.
        Automation     - "System Events", for log out / restart / shut down.

      The app is signed ad-hoc unless you created a local signing identity.
      Ad-hoc signatures change with every build, so the Accessibility grant
      has to be given again after each upgrade. For a stable signature:
        #{opt_pkgshare}/setup-signing.sh
        brew reinstall apolloshell
      (If the Homebrew build cannot reach your keychain, build with
      ./build.sh from a git checkout instead.)

      Start at login: System Settings > General > Login Items.
